# A separate Terraform deployment can be configured and executed in the context of an
# Organization Policy Administrator, however this requires Organization Policies applied to Folders
# to be configured in concert & two deployments executed.

# In lieu of the above, this file is to be configured with Code Owners security in GIT and managed by
# the Security Team. Folder IDs can therefore be dynamically passed to the Organization Policy Resources.
